# rust-html-vault

A lightweight static site generator built with **Rust**. This project demonstrates how to use Rust's file handling to generate a clean, dark-mode dashboard in HTML.

## Features
- **Rust Powered**: Core logic written in Rust.
- **Automated**: Generates `index.html` on execution.
- **Premium UI**: Modern dark-mode aesthetic (No "alay" green).

## How it Works
The program uses `std::fs` to write a formatted HTML string into a physical file, bridging the gap between systems programming and web display.

## Files
- `main.rs`: The "printer" logic.
- `index.html`: The generated output.
- `Cargo.toml`: Project configuration.
